# Portfolio

This portfolio was created by Jared Chesebro'

The purpose of this is sort of a placeholder for when I have actual projects to show off

I'll be honest im not super thrilled with how it currently looks. I think the layout is sort of bland and the color scheme is super uninteresting

I struggled quite a bit with flexbox I still dont feel like I have a hang of it just yet

Not sure what this readme is I don't know what else to put in here lul
