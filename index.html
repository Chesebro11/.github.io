                Hello! My name Is Jared and I'm currently enrolled in a bootcamp program at the U of O to learn coding. My goal through this bootcamp is to completely change my career path. For nearly seven years I worked in the
                food industry as a cook/kitchen manager even though I knew I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. My dream is to work in the games industry as my favorite hobby is gaming. I've spent nearly my entire life
                around computers and I've known for a while that I could always spend an endless amount of time learning as much as I can about them.
            </p>
