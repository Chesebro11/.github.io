        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <section class="aboutme-txt">
            <p>My name is Jared Chesebro', I was born in Houston, Texas and moved to Portland, Oregon 8 years ago.
            The majority of my career has been focused on working in the food industry, the majority of it was working in
            kitchens starting out as a dishwasher and eventually working my way up to management positions. If I'm being honest
            I was pretty tired of the usual things service workers had to deal with feeling under payed, under appreciated, and
            completely overworked. I decided to make a change in my career path and I'm now enrolled in a boot camp through 
            U of O to learn more about coding to seek out my dream career within the games industry.

                <p>Run Buddy ideally wont be here in the future, however it is an assignment that taught me
                everything I know so far about web development and I really need to fill this area up with projects</p>

                <p>This assignment was the first actual test about what I had been learning. I recieved a file of broken
                code and had to figure out what issues existed within the code while cleaning up any issues with syntax
                or an unnessecary amount of code</p>
